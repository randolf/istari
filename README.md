### ISTARI

The Istari ModPack combines the magical word of Lord of the Rings with the magical machines of Thaumcraft to place you
in the role of a young wizard just starting out on your first journeys in Middle Earth.  Explore the many exotic and
dangerous locations of Middle Earth while you learn your craft and become an ever more powerful mage. Trade with the
people you meet for food and equipment, but watch out for orcs, trolls, and even worse!

### GETTING STARTED

This repository has everything you need.  Just download a copy locally, and run the forge installer.  This will add a
new version of Forge to your launcher.  Launch Minecraft, and create a new profile which uses it. Point the profile to
the directory where you downloaded the repo, and you'll be ready to start your own single-player game.

To join the official server, open an issue on this repo and request to be added to the white-list.  You'll need to include a brief introduction of yourself (what timezone you live in, how long you've been playing, etc.).  Then write
something which will convince an admin you understand and agree to abide by the server's rules:

1. No uninvited PVP.
2. Do not disturb other player's creations, or build near them without permission.
3. Do not tear up the landscape without making something better from it.

An admin will add you to the whitelist, and close your issue after welcoming you to the server.  Once your issue is closed,
just point your client at `istari.tungstonminer.com` and log on. You're also strongly encouraged to join our [Discord
channel](https://discord.gg/Pa7PQXx) to chat with other players, see announcements about the server, etc.
