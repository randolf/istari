The Istari ModPack combines the magical word of Lord of the Rings with the magical machines of Thaumcraft to place you
in the role of a young wizard just starting out on your first journeys in Middle Earth.  Explore the many exotic and
dangerous locations of Middle Earth while you learn your craft and become an ever more powerful mage. Trade with the
people you meet for food and equipment, but watch out for orcs, trolls, and even worse!

Since this mod is largely based around the LotR Mod, and Thaumcraft 4, the following wikis will answer almost all of your questions:

* [Thaumcraft 4 Wiki](https://thaumcraft-4.fandom.com/wiki/Thaumcraft_4_Wiki)
* [Lord of the Rings Minecraft Mod Wiki](https://lotrminecraftmod.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Minecraft_Mod_Wiki)

There are a few other things related to the modpack which are addresses on [our own wiki](https://github.com/tungstonminer/istari/wiki).
